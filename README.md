# REDEFINE
"Reclassify Enhanced Data for Improved Normalization and Evaluation."
This goal for this project is to develop a pipeline that uses supervised classifiers and unsupervised cluster algorithms to analyze data and determine which, if any, data points may be misclassified.  This has been done on a smaller scale previously, so my main focus is generalizing the pipeline and providing more user options and useability.

### The Data
I have provided data for this project, however, it is mostly to be used for demo and testing purposes only.  The idea is for users to have their own data they want to run through the pipeline.  The data needs to be relatively small, classification datasets, and at the moment, numerical only (we'll see if I have time to add cleaning functionality).  The Sci-Kit Learn Iris dataset has been added to the web app as a "demo" data capability, both for users and for my personal convenience.

### Next steps
So far, I have the UI almost where I want it to be, so I just need to work out the plan for what to do with the results from the verification, then it should be done.  The back-end is the next on the docket--I need to complete both the verification steps as well as the actual pipeline.
